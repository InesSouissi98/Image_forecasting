# Image-based time series forecasting

In this project, we will develop a machine learning model to predict an image through 10 input images. The model will be trained on a dataset of images collected which are varying over time.

The dataset will be preprocessed by transforming images into tensors.
Machine learning algorithm such as Linear Regression will be tested and evaluated for its performance in predicting.
